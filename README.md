Project Name - DSA Tracker

How this was made (currently being built):

Initial Steps-

1. Create a folder called DSA Tracker, start VS Code and open the folder.
2. Create two folders inside it called frontend and backend.
3. Open two terminals and navigate to each of these folders with cd.
4. Once you are in the frontend folder inside the terminal we need to install React with Vite. Type - "npm create vite@latest .".
5. Install any required packages and then select React and JS when Vite prompts you.
6. After this Vite will tell you to run - "npm install" and then "npm run dev". You will start the development server and will be navigated to the project in your browser. All the content is default code that we will change later.
7. Install TailwindCSS, check tailwind documentation for tailwind installation with vite and follow those steps.
8. Install react-router-dom by typing "npm i react-router-dom" in the terminal.

Frontend Steps-

1. Removed boilerplate code.
2. Created a header component, styled with Tailwind CSS (Using online components for now and editing as needed).
3. Currently working on Dynamic Creation of Routes.

Backend Steps-

1. None so far as the routes are being made with react-router-dom.

Todo-

. Implement oauth.
. Implement storage with either Browser Storage or a database.
. Host on render or research if this oauth app can be deployed on github pages as that is preferable.

What I learned (so far):

. Vite + React
. React Router - Link
. Currently learning Dynamic Route Creation, useState and more.
